# D3-challenge
Working on using D3 with html and javascript to sort data.

https://tomknies.github.io/D3-challenge/index.html is the page with the graph.  Getting Git Hub to drop you straight onto it is another thing I need to fix in the next push.


With D3 and a .csv of US states' population health information, I can make a scatterplot of things such as the median age and percentage of smokers in a state.  At the time of writing, I'd like to improve the tooltip hover a bit to be more clear and detailed.  Also not transparent.

I don't know why the text I was given to include is gibberish (is it Latin?) and I'm thinking I should probably write my own actual interpretation of the data.

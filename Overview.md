# D3-challenge
Working on using D3 with html and javascript to sort data.


With D3 and a .csv of US states' population health information, I can make a scatterplot of things such as the median age
and percentage of smokers in a state.  At the time of writing, I'd like to improve the tooltip hover a bit to be more clear
and detailed.  Also not transparent.
